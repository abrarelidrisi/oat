      "correct_solution": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x), we must use the product rule, which states that (uv)' = u'v + uv'. Let u = x^2 and v = sin(x). Then u' = 2x and v' = cos(x). Applying the product rule, we get f'(x) = (2x)(sin(x)) + (x^2)(cos(x)). So the derivative is 2x*sin(x) + x^2*cos(x).",
      "incorrect_solution": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x), we differentiate each part separately. The derivative of x^2 is 2x and the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x). Therefore, the derivative is 2x * cos(x).",

      "question": "Let f(x) = (x^2+3x+2)/(x^2-x-2). Find the vertical asymptotes.",
      "correct_solution": "To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to find the values of x for which the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero. The denominator is x^2 - x - 2. Factoring the denominator, we get (x-2)(x+1). So the denominator is zero at x=2 and x=-1. Now we check the numerator at these values. The numerator is x^2 + 3x + 2, which factors to (x+1)(x+2). At x=2, the numerator is (2+1)(2+2) = 12, which is non-zero. So x=2 is a vertical asymptote. At x=-1, the numerator is (-1+1)(-1+2) = 0. Since both the numerator and denominator are zero at x=-1, there is a hole in the graph at x=-1, not a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the only vertical asymptote is x=2.",
      "incorrect_solution": "To find the vertical asymptotes, we must find where the denominator is zero. Factoring x^2 - x - 2 gives (x-2)(x+1) = 0. This means the vertical asymptotes are at x=2 and x=-1. The function is undefined at these two points.",

      "question": "What is the largest integer that is a divisor of `(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)` for all positive even integers `n`?",
      "correct_solution": "Let n=2k for some positive integer k. The expression is (2k+1)(2k+3)(2k+5). These are three consecutive odd integers. One of them must be a multiple of 3. Let's test n=2, we get 3*5*7=105. Let's test n=4, we get 5*7*9=315. The GCD of 105 and 315 is 105. Let's test n=6, we get 7*9*11=693. The GCD of 105, 315, 693 is 21. Let's test n=8, we get 9*11*13=1287. The GCD of 21 and 1287 is 3. Let's reconsider. The terms are n+1, n+3, n+5. One of these must be divisible by 3. If n is an even number, n can be written as 2k. The terms are 2k+1, 2k+3, 2k+5. If k=1, n=2, we get 3,5,7. If k=2, n=4, we get 5,7,9. If k=3, n=6, we get 7,9,11. In any set of three consecutive odd integers, one must be divisible by 3. Let's check for 5. The residues mod 5 are 2k+1, 2k+3, 2k. One of these is 0 mod 5 if 2k is 0, 2, or 4 mod 5. This is not guaranteed. The product is always divisible by 3. The question is flawed. Re-reading: The problem is for all *positive* even integers. Let n=2, we get 3*5*7=105. Let n=4, we get 5*7*9=315. Let n=6, we get 7*9*11=693. Let's find the GCD(105, 315, 693). GCD(105, 315) = 105. GCD(105, 693) = 21. Let n=8, we get 9*11*13=1287. GCD(21, 1287) = 3. What if n=12? 13*15*17. Divisible by 3 and 5. GCD is 15. The problem seems to be 15, but it is not obvious why. Let's retry: n=2k. (2k+1)(2k+3)(2k+5). Divisibility by 3 is guaranteed. For any 3 consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3. 2k+1, 2k+2, 2k+3. So either 2k+1 or 2k+3 is divisible by 3. Not true. Let k=2, n=4 -> 5, 7, 9. 9 is div by 3. Let k=3, n=6 -> 7, 9, 11. 9 is div by 3. Let k=4, n=8 -> 9, 11, 13. 9 is div by 3. So one term is always div by 3. The product is always divisible by 3. Let's test n=2 -> 3*5*7, n=4 -> 5*7*9, n=6 -> 7*9*11, n=8 -> 9*11*13, n=10 -> 11*13*15. The GCD of these numbers is 3. The problem statement in many sources states the answer is 15 or 45, implying an error in reasoning. Let's assume the product is always divisible by 3. Final answer based on testing small cases is 3.",
      "incorrect_solution": "Let n be a positive even integer. We can test a few values. For n=2, the expression is (2+1)(2+3)(2+5) = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105. For n=4, the expression is (4+1)(4+3)(4+5) = 5 * 7 * 9 = 315. The greatest common divisor of 105 and 315 is 105. Therefore, the largest integer that divides the expression for all positive even integers n is 105.",
