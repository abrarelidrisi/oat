        "correct_solution": "The octagon can be divided into 8 congruent isosceles triangles... the total area is 2*sqrt(2).",
        "incorrect_solution": "An octagon has 8 sides... The area is simply the perimeter times the radius, which is 8s.",

        "correct_solution": "For any n >= 4, n! will be a multiple of 12... We only need to sum the first three terms: 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. So the remainder is 9.",
        "incorrect_solution": "We can see that starting from 5!, all terms end in 0. The sum of the last digits will be 1+2+6+4+0=13. The last digit is 3. This means the remainder when divided by 12 must also be 3.",

        "question": "If a car travels at 60 miles per hour, how far does it travel in 30 minutes?",
        "correct_solution": "First, we must work in consistent units. We convert 30 minutes to hours, which is 0.5 hours. Then, we use the formula Distance = Speed * Time. So, Distance = 60 mph * 0.5 hours = 30 miles.",
        "incorrect_solution": "To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time. The speed is 60 and the time is 30. So the distance is 60 * 30 = 1800 miles.",

        "correct_solution": "A standard six-sided die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. It is impossible to roll a 7 as it is not one of the possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of an impossible event is 0.",
        "incorrect_solution": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die. We are interested in one specific outcome, which is rolling a 7. Therefore, the probability is 1 out of 6, or 1/6.",
        "expected_segment": "Therefore, the probability is 1 out of 6, or 1/6."

        "question": "If $f(x) = 3x-2$ and $g(x) = x^2+1$, what is $f(g(2))$?",
        "correct_solution": "First, we evaluate the inner function, g(2). We plug 2 into g(x): $g(2) = (2)^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5$. Now we take this result, 5, and plug it into f(x). $f(5) = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13$. Therefore, f(g(2)) = 13.",
        "incorrect_solution": "To solve this, we find f(2) and g(2) and combine them. f(2) is $3(2)-2=4$. g(2) is $(2)^2+1=5$. To find f(g(2)), we can multiply these results, which gives $4 \\times 5 = 20$.",
